# Markov-Chains-Music-Player
This was a project made for EE305: Applied Probability for Engineers. Due to that fact, no code is featured in this repository as that would violate SUNY Buffalo's Academic Integrity Policy. This repo will contain a manual on Markov chains created by me, and how similar projects can be implemented by others!
